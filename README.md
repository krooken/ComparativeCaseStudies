# Stick-picking game
The stick-picking game is a simple game frequently used to demonstrate concepts of DES and SCT. Two players take turns drawing one, two or three sticks from a pile, initially containing seven sticks. Players are not allowed to skip their turn, and the player who draws the last stick loses the game. 

There is a winning strategy for player one if he or she starts the game by picking 2 sticks. Regardless of the number of sticks now picked by player two, player one can next pick a number of sticks such that only 1 stick remains, offering player two no choice but losing the game.

TuLiP and Supremica models of the stick-picking game are found in the StickPicking folder.

# AD-vehicle
A simplified autonomous driving (AD) model involving two vehicles: an AD vehicle and a manually driven vehicle. The two vehicles are travelling on a circular road with two lanes in the same direction. The problem is to design a controller for the AD-vehicle that at all  times guarantees a safe distance between the two vehicles. That is to say, the AD-vehicle observes the behavior of the manually driven vehicle, and adjusts its own actions accordingly, such that collisions are always avoided.

TuLiP and Supremica models of the AD-example are found in the AutonomousDriving folder.
